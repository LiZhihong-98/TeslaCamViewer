# HTML Driven Tesla Dashcam Viewer
An extremely simple HTML Dashcam Viewer

The `index.html` file should be able to run straight in a browser. No server support has been coded into this file.

Copy the `TeslaCam` folder from your USB to the same directory as `index.html`
```
Root Folder
|- index.html
|- TeslaCam(USB Drive Top Level Folder) < -- select this folder
    |- Saved Clips
    |- Sentry Videos
    |- ...
```
Open the `index.html` file. This should open it in a browser window and you'll be greeted with a very plain looking HTML page.

Note: Root folder can be the top directory of the USB.
Tested running `index.html` on macOS however you may need to close the browser before being able to eject the USB.
